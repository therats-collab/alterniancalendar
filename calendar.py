#################
## Time is considered to have "started being a thing" at the epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC) and this calendar isn't meant for times before that.
## You can figure that out if you want, but I'm not doing it here.
## However, for synchrosity with Earth Years, the Alternian calendar starts at (1970 years worth of sweeps, aka 912) instead of Sweep 0.
## 
## Earth-Specific Assumptions:
## > Each day is exactly 24*60*60 seconds, none of this leap-second bullshittery.
## Alternia-Specific Assumptions:
## > Date stuff is counting from 0, and then increased to 1 for the user (i.e. there is a 0th day internally)
